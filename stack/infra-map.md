# Infra map

Topology of where things actually run. Populated by the devops kit (or
your knowledge of it).

The point is to answer, for any sub-repo, *"where does this run, what
does it talk to, who can reach it, what's its blast radius if it fails?"*

---

## Cloud

*Provider, accounts/subscriptions, regions, primary vs secondary.*

- _(populate)_

## Compute

*Clusters, node pools, namespaces, function apps, container apps —
whatever the actual compute fabric is. Per environment (dev / staging /
prod).*

- _(populate)_

## Networking

*Ingress controllers, load balancers, DNS zones, public vs private
endpoints, VPN / private link, internal service-to-service routing.*

- _(populate)_

## Data plane

*Databases (engine, version, sharding), caches, object storage, queues,
event streams. Per environment.*

- _(populate)_

## Identity & secrets

*Workload identity, federated auth, secret store, key vaults, where
credentials live and how they rotate.*

- _(populate)_

## CI / CD

*Where pipelines run, how artifacts get from commit to prod, who has
deploy authority, rollback mechanism.*

- _(populate)_

## Observability

*Metrics backend, logs backend, traces, alerting, on-call routing.*

- _(populate)_

## Diagram

*Optional: ASCII or mermaid diagram of the topology. Skip if
inventory + sections above are clear enough.*
