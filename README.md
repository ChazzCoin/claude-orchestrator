# claude-orchestrator

A distributable Claude Code template for **macro architectural truth
across one company's stack**. CTO-assistant scaffolding — not a coding
kit, not a task tracker.

> **Why this exists.** You have N codebases that should stay coherent
> (e.g. `api`, `ios`, `web`, `devops`). Each has its own claude-kit.
> Each kit thinks locally. Nothing holds the whole picture. This is
> that thing.

This repo is the **kit/template**. Run `bin/init` to bootstrap a
per-company instance. `/sync` propagates kit updates into existing
instances.

Modeled on [claude-kit](https://github.com/ChazzCoin/claude-kit) —
same shape (`kit/` synced + `bootstrap/` one-time + `MANIFEST.json` +
`bin/init` + `/sync`), different purpose.

---

## What an instance holds

**Anchors** *(rarely change)*

- `tech-vision.md` — long-arc direction (12–18 months)
- `tech-principles.md` — how decisions get made
- `platform-constraints.md` — runtime / infra realities

**Macro state** *(populated via `/audit`, evolved over time)*

- `stack/` — inventory + infra map
- `contracts/` — data models, endpoints, events
- `conventions/` — naming, error handling, auth

**Operational registries** *(filled as data exists)*

- `vendors.md` — third-party deps with renewals + risk profile
- `ownership.md` — who owns what, on-call, escalation
- `slos.md` — service-level objectives per sub-repo
- `cost-tracking.md` — cloud + vendor spend trend
- `security-posture.md` — audits, gaps, practices
- `compliance.md` — frameworks (SOC2 / GDPR / etc.)

**Design / brand**

- `design/brand.md` — color palette, typography scale, voice, tone
  *(source of truth for tokens — other places copy from here)*
- `design/assets.md` — registry of canonical asset files (logos,
  icons, illustrations) with version + owner
- `design/materials.md` — collateral specs (business cards,
  signatures, letterhead, swag, decks)
- `design/mobile.md` — mobile graphics package (app icons, splash,
  in-app artwork, store assets)
- `design/web.md` — web design system specs (components, page
  templates, breakpoints)

**Active state** *(changes regularly)*

- `roadmap.md` — what's being steered toward
- `open-questions.md` — parking lot
- `state/manifest.md` — registered sub-repos
- `AUDIT.md` — chronological log of macro actions

**Artifacts** *(one per concern, with templates synced from kit)*

- `decisions/` — ADRs
- `features/` — cross-cutting feature plans
- `migrations/{active,closed}/` — coordinated state transitions
- `risks/{open,mitigated}/` — risk register
- `incidents/` — cross-stack postmortems
- `reviews/{weekly,monthly,quarterly}/` — recurring CTO check-ins
- `pr-reviews/` — orchestrator-grade macro PR reviews

The orchestrator does not dispatch work to sub-kits. It does not own
a task list. It holds truth, makes drift visible, and gives the user
one reasoning surface across software, infra, and product.

---

## Sub-projects

The orchestrator is **sub-project agnostic** — works with both
kit-enabled (claude-kit installed) and non-kit sub-projects.

**Four sanctioned write paths** into a sub-repo:

1. **Migration notices** — structured `<sub>/.claude/active-<concern>.md`
   files. Templates in
   [`kit/templates/sub-repo-notices/`](kit/templates/sub-repo-notices/).
2. **Doc / config / spec changes** — orchestrator drafts directly,
   opens a `chore/orch-*` PR, user approves the merge. **No task
   spec.**
3. **Coding-task specs** — drafted into `<sub>/tasks/backlog/`
   (kit-enabled only). Sub-kit ships the code.
4. **claude-kit install** — orchestrator runs `bin/init` against the
   sub-project (with user approval).

**Tasks are for coding work.** Doc / config / spec changes the
orchestrator does itself via PR. The split is load-bearing.

**Sub-kit advertisement protocol** *(voluntary)* — sub-kit MAY write
`<sub>/.claude/active.md` to advertise its current state to the
orchestrator. Template in
[`kit/templates/sub-repo-advertisement/`](kit/templates/sub-repo-advertisement/).

Full discipline lives in [`kit/sub-projects.md`](kit/sub-projects.md).
The shape of claude-kit (so the orchestrator knows what it's reading
in kit-enabled sub-projects) is pinned at
[`kit/claude-kit-reference.md`](kit/claude-kit-reference.md).

For the read-side to work in claude-kit'd sub-projects, claude-kit
needs the matching session-start rule. See
[`feat/orchestrator-integration` in claude-kit](https://github.com/ChazzCoin/claude-kit/tree/feat/orchestrator-integration).

**`kit/`** = synced files. Improvements here propagate to every
instance that runs `/sync`.

**`bootstrap/`** = one-time files. Init copies them once if they
don't exist; they belong to the instance after that and never get
overwritten by `/sync`.

---

## Bootstrapping a new orchestrator instance

```sh
gh repo create <company>-orchestrator --private
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<company>-orchestrator
git clone https://github.com/ChazzCoin/claude-orchestrator /tmp/claude-orchestrator
/tmp/claude-orchestrator/bin/init <company>-orchestrator
cd <company>-orchestrator
# fill in the {{COMPANY_NAME}} / {{COMPANY_PURPOSE}} placeholders in
# CLAUDE.md and README.md, commit, push.
```

The init script:

1. Copies `kit/orchestrator-rules.md` to `<target>/.claude/`.
2. Mirrors `kit/skills/` into `<target>/.claude/skills/`.
3. Mirrors `kit/templates/` into `<target>/.claude/templates/`
   (used by skills that render into sub-repos).
4. Mirrors `kit/decisions/`, `kit/features/`, `kit/migrations/`,
   `kit/risks/`, `kit/incidents/`, `kit/reviews/`,
   `kit/state/README.md` into the matching instance directories.
5. Copies `bootstrap/*.template` into the instance — skip-if-exists.
   That includes CLAUDE.md, README, roadmap, open-questions,
   platform-constraints, tech-vision, tech-principles, vendors,
   ownership, slos, cost-tracking, security-posture, compliance,
   AUDIT, plus stack/, contracts/, conventions/, state/manifest.md.
6. Stamps `<target>/.claude/foundation.json` with the kit's commit
   SHA so `/sync` knows what to compare against.
7. Scaffolds `migrations/{active,closed}/`, `risks/{open,mitigated}/`,
   `reviews/{weekly,monthly,quarterly}/` with `.gitkeep`.
8. Drops a default `.gitignore` if missing.
9. Prints next steps.

After init, the founder fills in the placeholders, commits the
bootstrap content, and pushes. Then `/register` adds each sub-repo
to the manifest (per-repo, deliberate; clones into `repos/<name>/`).
Once the manifest is populated and pushed, the instance is portable.

---

## Instance layout (after init + /register)

```
<company>-orchestrator/              cloned from <org>/<company>-orchestrator
├── .git/                            the orchestrator's repo
├── .claude/                         skills, rules, foundation.json
├── bin/setup                        clones registered sub-repos
├── decisions/, state/, ...          the brain
└── repos/                           GITIGNORED — sub-repos clone here
    ├── api/                         (its own .git, working copy)
    ├── ios/
    ├── web/
    └── devops/
```

`repos/` is gitignored. Sub-repos retain their own `.git`. Path is
**convention** — always `<orchestrator-root>/repos/<name>/`, never
stored in any state file, never varies per machine. Existing
checkouts elsewhere on the user's machine are not referenced — the
orchestrator manages its own canonical local copies.

---

## Onboarding a collaborator

After the founder has registered sub-repos and pushed, anyone
joining the company:

```sh
git clone <org>/<company>-orchestrator
cd <company>-orchestrator
bin/setup    # clones every registered sub-repo into repos/<name>/
```

Fully automatic — no per-repo prompting. Idempotent (safe to re-run
after fixing auth or network issues). Open Claude Code in the
instance and run `/onboard` for orientation on what's open and where
to look first.

Mobile / remote-only environments skip `bin/setup`. Read-side skills
(`/brief`, `/status`, `/sync-check`) fall back to `gh api` queries
against the manifest's `git_remote`. Write-side operations
(`/migration` updating notice files, `/register` cloning) require a
local clone and so are deferred to a machine that's run setup.

---

## Skills shipped

Run `/skills` inside an instance after init to see the live list.
Current set:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/audit` | Interview-driven macro audit — stack, contracts, conventions, constraints. v1 entry point. |
| `/brief` | Synthesized daily orientation across sub-repos + orchestrator artifacts (stub). |
| `/decision` | Draft a macro-level ADR, referencing `tech-principles.md`. |
| `/feature` | Author a cross-cutting feature plan. |
| `/incident` | Log a cross-stack incident, draft postmortem (stub). |
| `/migration` | Open, update, list, or close a cross-repo migration. |
| `/onboard` | Synthesize current orchestrator state for a new collaborator. |
| `/register` | Register a new sub-repo in `state/manifest.md`. |
| `/review` | Run weekly / monthly / quarterly review (stub). |
| `/risk` | File a risk in the register, update, or mitigate (stub). |
| `/skills` | List every locally-defined skill. |
| `/status` | Current macro picture at a glance. |
| `/sync` | Pull updates from this kit into the instance. |
| `/sync-check` | Surface drift between sub-repos and the orchestrator's contracts. |

**(stub)** = skill scaffolding is in place; behavior contract is
provisional and gets refined on first real use.

---

## Iterating

### "I improved a skill in instance A — get it into the kit"

1. In instance A, edit `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
2. Copy that change into the claude-orchestrator repo's
   `kit/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.
3. Commit + push to claude-orchestrator.
4. In instance B (and every other instance), run `/sync` and accept
   the skill update.

`/sync` is the one-way valve. It reads from the kit, never writes
back. Pushing improvements upstream is a manual git operation —
intentional, so changes are reviewed.

### "I want to override a kit file in one instance only"

Edit the file locally. `/sync` detects the divergence as a "local
override" and won't overwrite it without approval. The override
gets recorded in `.claude/foundation.json`.

### "The kit shipped a bad change — I want to roll back"

```sh
# In claude-orchestrator:
git revert <bad-commit>
git push
# Then in each instance:
/sync   # picks up the revert
```

Or pin to an older commit by editing `.claude/foundation.json`'s
`pinned_sha` field manually.

---

## Design principles

- **Generic where possible, specific where it matters.** Skills and
  ADR/feature/migration templates are generic; instance-specific
  content lives in `bootstrap/` files that the instance owns
  post-init.
- **One-way sync.** Kit → instance. Improvements flow back via
  manual git, not auto-push. Reviews matter.
- **Never auto-commit.** Skills that modify files leave changes
  staged or unstaged for human review.
- **Honest about drift.** `/sync` surfaces conflicts, doesn't
  silently merge.

---

## Long-term direction

Markdown contracts are temporary. Once a company's audit stabilizes
and the API shape is known, migrate `contracts/` to an executable
spec (OpenAPI, protobuf, or a shared types package) and generate
clients. Drift then becomes a compile error rather than a discipline.
